# Solar-Portfolio

Work in progress, but this will be updated with an example of degradation (rdtools, YoY method) and modeling (pvlib) and other solar statistics, probably using the test BP dataset that is used in the Rdtools example.<br>
Unfortunately the data file is too big to put into the github repo. You can see the site info in the link below, but the data format has changed so that it does not currently include met station data; PR is pre-calculated in the report. We will use an old version I saved in 2019, and if you are particularly interested you can contact me.<br>
