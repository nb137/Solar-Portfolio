# Solar-Portfolio

This is a ork in progress, but this will be updated with an example of degradation (rdtools, YoY method) and modeling (pvlib) and other solar statistics.<br><br>
First, you might be interested in seeing my poster from the PVRW 2020 “A case study in year-on-year trending of photovoltaic performance ratio” which can be found here: https://pvrw.nrel.gov/sites/default/files/PVRW_2020_final_program.pdf
<br><br>
A brief example of using rdtools can be found on this [Degradation Analysis notebook](DegradationAnalysis.ipynb).<br>
An example of an energy model using pvlib can be found in a [fake site energy report](SiteEnergyModel.ipynb).<br>
An analysis of soiling, rainfall, and general investigation into panel cleaning is in the works.<br><br>

Unfortunately the example data file is too big to put into the github repo. You can see the site info in the link below, but the data format has changed so that it does not currently include met station data if you download it now. We will use an old version I saved in 2019, and if you are particularly interested in the file I use you can contact me.<br>
